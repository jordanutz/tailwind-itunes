/*

- To avoid potential duplication issues, Tailwind provides @apply directive, which can be used to compose a group of utilities into a reusuable component class. 
- Useful feature when you want to extract repeated combinations of utility classes, but cautioned. 
- Most useful for individual form elements and buttons, which are more repeated throughout and single HTML tags.
